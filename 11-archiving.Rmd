# Overview

## Overview

- Data Sharing (publishing) via Archives: Hands-on (20:00)
- What if Data are Sensitive? (15:00)
- Licensing for Ethical Data Sharing (10:00)

## Goals of this tutorial

- Goal 1: Be able to curate the data and code necessary for reproducible analysis
- Goal 2: Know when to do so
- Goal 3: Choose license (while respecting ethics)

## Background 

- [Implementing Increased Transparency and Reproducibility in Economics 2020 Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj-y3dLDOEA)

Questions/ What-ifs:

-  the data is not on your laptop?
  - too big
  - on server
  - a database
- the data is not yours to send
  - confidentiality
  - proprietary
  - other licensing issues

## The point of FAIR principles

::: {.columns-2}

:::: {.column}

"Good data management is not a goal in itself, but rather is the key conduit leading to knowledge discovery and innovation, and to subsequent data and knowledge integration and reuse by the community after the data publication process."

::::

:::: {.column}

"FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals."

# What is preservation

## Preservation {.smaller}

::: {.columns-2}

:::: {.column}

- Preservation != publication, != sharing
- In fact, preservation may mean: not very accessible at all!
- Preservation is intended to maintain data for tens, even hundreds of years
  - Preservation may involve curation: active transformation of the data for improved accessibility

## What is publication


Publication typically involves making information about the data, as well as the data themselves, available to others.

- Publication can initially mean that only **metadata** (information about the data) is published
- In some cases, it may be that **only** metadata is ever published
- But the metadata will point to how to access the data, how long the data will be preserved, and other salient facts


## FAIR Principles {.smaller}

::: {.columns-2}

:::: {.column}

To be Findable:

- F1. **(meta)data are assigned a globally unique and eternally persistent identifier.**
- F2. data are described with rich metadata.
- F3. **(meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource.**
- F4. metadata specify the data identifier.

::::

:::: {.column}

To be Accessible:

- A1 **(meta)data** are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol.
- A2 metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available.

::::

:::

## FAIR Principles {.smaller}

::: {.columns-2}

:::: {.column}

To be Interoperable:

- I1. **(meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.**
- I2. **(meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles.**
- I3. (meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data.

::::

:::: {.column}

To be Re-usable:

- R1. meta(data) have a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes.
- R1.1. **(meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license.**
- R1.2. **(meta)data are associated with their provenance.**
- R1.3. (meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards.

## FAIR Metadata when data are not shareable

::: {.columns-2}

:::: {.column}


IAB: [Establishment History Panel (BHP) - Version 7518 v1](https://doi.org/10.5164/IAB.BHP7518.de.en.v1) at [https://doi.org/10.5164/IAB.BHP7518.de.en.v1](https://doi.org/10.5164/IAB.BHP7518.de.en.v1)

Access conditions involve application process.

<img alt="iab Access metadata" src="images/iab-metadata-screenshot2.png" width="100%">

But information ABOUT the access process (=metadata) is available.

::::

:::

## What kind of access conditions? {.smaller}

::: {.columns-2}

:::: {.column}

In decreasing order of "freely available"

- Freely available (waive copyright)
- Attribution requested (e.g., citation): for instance, "CC-BY"
- **Available only to university researchers**
- **Available after embargo**

::::

:::: {.column}

- Available after application process handled by a data provider
  - Only checks for legal compliance
- Available with permission of the original researchers
  - Checks for why you use it
- Only available if you are called "Lars"

# This all seems so complicated

## This all seems so complicated

- I need to preserve my data for decades!
- I need to manage the application process for decades!
- Where do I get that DOI thing?
- How to I get Google to index my data?



# Let's start

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/giphy_scan.gif" width="50%" alt="scan" />
</div>

## Imperfect example

- Original data
- Analysis data
- Analysis code
- Analysis output



## Options for Preservation (1)


**Trusted Repositories**

Journals and institutions have assessed a number of trusted repositories:
- [CoreTrustSeal](https://www.coretrustseal.org/) has a certification process
- [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/) lists research data repositories
- [Nature](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories), [F1000Research](https://f1000research.com/for-authors/data-guidelines#hosting), and [PLOS](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability) have lists of trusted repositories. 
- Always check with your journal for specific restrictions or suggestions.

## Options for Preservation (2)

**Trusted Repositories**

- These generally include at least the following:
  -  [Dryad Digital Repository](http://datadryad.org/)
  -  [figshare](http://figshare.com/)
  -  [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu)
  -  [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/) and [OPENICPSR](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/)
  -  [Open Science Framework](http://osf.io/)
  -  [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org/)
  - Country or region-specific repositories (that nevertheless generally accept depositors from anywhere): [GESIS](https://datorium.gesis.org/xmlui/) (Germany), [Swedish National Data Service (SND)](https://snd.gu.se/en/describe-and-deposit-data), [EASY](https://easy.dans.knaw.nl/ui/home) (Netherlands), [CSIRO](https://data.csiro.au/collections/) (Australia), etc.
- Many universities have formal document repositories that may be able to assume such a role; talk to your (data) librarian
